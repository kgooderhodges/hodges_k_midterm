				<p class="first-cap">
				“Not all heroes wear capes” is a popular phrase that rings true for 37-year-old Daine Winkle, a consistent blood donor for the last 19 years.</p>

				<p>After going through a traumatic experience with his family as a teenager, he makes it his point of duty to contribute to the National Blood Transfusion Service (NBTS) twice per year.</p>

				<p>“When I was 17-years-old, my mom had complications when she was giving birth to my sister. She needed blood to do the operation but there was no blood at the Blood Bank. The whole situation made me nervous but thankfully, my mom and sister made it out alright and healthy. Since then, I made a commitment to give blood to prevent someone going through what we went through. If I can help someone then I am happy,” Winkle said.</p>

				<p class="first-cap"> Luis Prata, currently director of on-trade and wholesale at Heineken Portugal, took over as Red Stripe MD last week, the company said. Prata replaces Ricardo Nuncio who has been appointed director of northeast sales for Heineken Mexico.</p>

				<p>Nuncio took over at Red Stripe just after Heineken secured majority control of the Jamaican beer unit from Diageo in 2015. Heineken bought Diageo’s 58% stake in Red Stripe brewer Desnoes & Geddes (D&G) to hold a 73% share.</p>
					
				<p>The divestment was part of Diageo’s offloading of non-core assets.</p>
					
				<p>Prata joined Heineken in 2010 as water business unit director in Portugal. He later became marketing director in the country. Prior to joining Heineken, Prata worked in several commercial roles at Unilever in Europe.</p>
