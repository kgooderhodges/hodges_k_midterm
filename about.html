			<p>On a small island in the Caribbean Sea, bursting with flavours of rum, reggae and beautiful beaches, this long-standing cultural classic is brewed to perfection. Since 1918 Desnoes and Geddes Company have been a big part of the Jamaican life, first producing soft drinks and selling imported beer, but then following the owners, Thomas Hargreaves Geddes and Eugene Desnoes, dream of open the first brewery in Jamaica. A decade later and the Surrey Brewery was opened for business and brewed the first ever Red Stripe beer. After the initial brewing, Red Stripe spent the next few years morphing into different types of beer, till an American brewer in financial trouble sold the Red Stripe pale ale recipe to Desnoes and Geddes British investors. By 1934 Paul Geddes (son of Thomas Geddes) and Bill Martindale produced the first iteration of the Pale Ale Red Stripe beer, and Jamaica took notice. Since 1918 Desnoes and Geddes wanted to move into the brewing industry, since both men had great success with soft drinks, they wanted to make a beer that Jamaica could be proud of calling its own. Jamaica was still under British rule when the company opened and imported all the countries beer, but Red Stripe was taking a hold of Jamaica with its delicious taste and cheap price. The English imports were losing sales to Red Stripes, so as a way of retaliating in 1935 a local goods tax was placed on specific goods, including local beer. But thanks to the public outcry about the tax, it was quietly repealed, until 5 years later when the British were able to impose the tax once World War II started. Simply stating that Jamaica would have to pay their share of the war. With war comes the troops, so with troops coming to Jamaica from Canada and the United States the exposure to Red Stripe was increasing as well as the sales.</p>
